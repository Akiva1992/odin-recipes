        <h2>EASY HEALTHY SANDWICH BREAD</h2>
        <p>The most delicious soft and fluffy healthy sandwich bread ever! 
        This recipe is so easy to make and can be customized with the ingredients you have at home.</p>
        <h3>ingredients List:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>White flour:</strong> Use any white flour you have. Cake flour, All purpose or Bread flour will work.</li>
            <li><strong>Whole wheat flour.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Quick-cooking oats.</strong> If you only have rolled oats, give it a quick pulse in the food processor to break it up a little.</li>
            <li><strong>Seeds.</strong> I used a mix but any seeds you have will do. Pumpkin, sesame, flax, chia, poppy and sunflower seeds are all delicious in this bread.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt + Sugar. </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Instant yeast.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Water </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Butter / oil.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Combine yeast, warm (not hot) water and sugar in a bowl/measuring jug and mix well.
         Allow to stand for 5 minutes until foamy. 
         Combine the flours (start with only 2 cups of white flour), oats, seeds and salt in a large bowl and mix. 
         Pour in the yeast mixture and bring together into a rough dough. Mix in the room temperature butter or oil and knead. Add the remaining flour, 
         a tablespoon at a time, and knead until the dough is smooth and soft. You might not need all the flour. 
         It should be slightly tacky but not overly sticky.</li>
            <li><strong>Allow to rise:</strong> Cover the dough with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and allow to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size. Transfer the dough to a loaf pan and cover again. (When transferring the dough, I loosen it from the bowl, pick it up and place it in the loaf pan, smooth-side up.) Allow to rise for 30 minutes in the pan while the oven preheats.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the bread:</strong> Brush the top of the loaf with a beaten egg then sprinkle on some extra seeds and oats. \
            Place in the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. 
            Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
